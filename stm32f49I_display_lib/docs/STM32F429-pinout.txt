Pin Configuration List for Flappy Bird FFI Project
Clock/Oscillator Pins
PF0 (OSC_IN) - External 8MHz crystal oscillator input
PF1 (OSC_OUT) - External 8MHz crystal oscillator output
LCD Display Interface (GC9A01A) - 19 pins total
Control Pins:

PA3 (LCD_CSX) - Chip Select (active low)
PA15 (LCD_WRX) - Write strobe (active low)
PB0 (LCD_RDX) - Read strobe (active low)
PB1 (LCD_DCX) - Data/Command select (0=Command, 1=Data)
PB8 (LCD_RESET) - Display reset (active low)
PA4 (LCD_BL_A) - Backlight control (PWM/Digital)
Data Bus (8-bit parallel interface):

PA10 (LCD_DATA0) - Data bit 0 (LSB)
PA9 (LCD_DATA1) - Data bit 1
PB15 (LCD_DATA2) - Data bit 2
PB14 (LCD_DATA3) - Data bit 3
PB13 (LCD_DATA4) - Data bit 4
PB12 (LCD_DATA5) - Data bit 5
PB11 (LCD_DATA6) - Data bit 6
PB10 (LCD_DATA7) - Data bit 7 (MSB)
I2C Bus (MPU6050 & Touchscreen) - 2 pins
PB6 (MPU6050_TSC_SCL) - I2C1 Clock (configured in Rust as AF4, open-drain)
PB7 (MPU6050_TSC_SDA) - I2C1 Data (configured in Rust as AF4, open-drain)
Shared between MPU6050 gyro/accelerometer and CST816S touch controller
Touchscreen Controller (CST816S) - 2 pins
PB4 (TP_RST) - Touch controller reset
PB5 (TP_INT) - Touch controller interrupt (EXTI5 - rising edge trigger)
Pin Summary by Function:
Display: 14 pins (6 control + 8 data)
I2C Communication: 2 pins (shared bus for MPU6050 and touchscreen)
Touch Control: 2 pins (reset + interrupt)
Clock: 2 pins (external oscillator)
Total GPIO: 20 pins
Important Notes:
All LCD pins are configured as high-speed GPIO outputs
I2C pins (PB6/PB7) require external pull-up resistors (typically 4.7kΩ)
The touchscreen interrupt (PB5) is configured for external interrupt on rising edge
System runs at 72MHz (PLL from 8MHz HSE, multiplied by 9)
APB1 bus (I2C) runs at 36MHz (72MHz / 2)
